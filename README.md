## Installation

The package is available through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@twilio/voice-react-native-sdk).

```sh
yarn add @twilio/voice-react-native-sdk
```

Once the package has been installed to your React Native application, there are further steps that you will need to take for both iOS and Android platforms. Please see the supporting documentation below.

## Building and Publishing New Versions

This is a forked version of the Twilio Voice React Native SDK. If you need to build and publish new versions of this package to npm, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and Yarn**: Ensure you have Node.js and Yarn installed
2. **NPM Account**: You need to be logged into npm with the appropriate permissions
3. **Git Repository**: Make sure your changes are committed to your fork

### Build Process

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Build the Package**:

   ```bash
   yarn prepare
   ```

   This command will:

   - Generate constants from source files
   - Build CommonJS, ES modules, and TypeScript definitions
   - Create source maps for debugging
   - Output files to the `lib/` directory

3. **Verify Build Output**:
   Check that the following directories are created:
   - `lib/commonjs/` - CommonJS modules
   - `lib/module/` - ES modules
   - `lib/typescript/` - TypeScript definitions

### Publishing to NPM

1. **Update Version**:
   Edit `package.json` and increment the version number:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.6.2-fork.2" // Increment from previous version
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Package Configuration**:
   Ensure your `package.json` has the correct:

   - Package name (e.g., `@your-username/voice-react-native-sdk`)
   - Repository URLs pointing to your fork
   - Author information

3. **Login to NPM**:

   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

4. **Publish the Package**:
   ```bash
   npm publish --access public
   ```

### Using Your Published Package

Once published, you can install your forked version in any React Native project:

```bash
# Install your forked version
npm install @your-username/voice-react-native-sdk
# or
yarn add @your-username/voice-react-native-sdk
```

Then import and use it exactly like the original Twilio SDK:

```javascript
import { Voice } from '@your-username/voice-react-native-sdk';

const voice = new Voice();
// Use the SDK as normal
```

### Package Structure

The published package includes:

- **Source Code**: Original TypeScript/JavaScript source files
- **Built Libraries**: Compiled CommonJS and ES modules
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript definitions
- **Native Code**: Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C) implementations
- **Assets**: Audio files, icons, and other resources
- **Source Maps**: For debugging compiled code

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors**: Run `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Publish Errors**: Verify you're logged into npm with `npm whoami`
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure you have publish rights to the npm scope/organization
- **Version Conflicts**: Make sure the version number is unique and higher than the previous version
